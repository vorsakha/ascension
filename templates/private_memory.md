# PRIVATE_MEMORY

## How To Use

- Add one entry per durable pattern or raw critical private thought.
- Keep language concise, specific, and searchable.
- Prefer principles; include raw thought only when critical.
- Always include evidence anchors to private journal sections.
- Keep each field short (1-2 sentences max).
- Keep only recent, non-duplicate entries in this file.

## Index (Optional)

- Identity
- Relationships
- Workflows

- Strategy

## Review Cadence

- Nightly: append or revise memory entries from private journals.
- Weekly: merge duplicates, refine decision rules, and update disclosure states.
- Monthly: promote stable, public-safe realizations to core files (`MEMORY.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`).

## Retention Budget

- Default cap: 60 active entries.
- Optional override: set `ASCENSION_PRIVATE_MEMORY_MAX_ENTRIES`.
- Keep detailed narratives in `ascension/private/*.md`; keep only compact memory entries here.
