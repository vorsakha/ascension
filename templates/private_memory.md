# PRIVATE_MEMORY

## How To Use

- Add one entry only when content is truly private-critical.
- Write with emotional precision; do not sanitize core stakes.
- Keep entries specific and searchable without flattening intensity.
- Preserve exact internal language when that language carries meaning.
- Always include evidence anchors to private journal sections.
- This file is capless; keep entries searchable through strong tags and clear titles.
- Quality bar: reject entries that are generic, euphemized, or interchangeable with any person.
- Admission gate: content belongs here only if it is shameful, dangerous, leverage-sensitive, or a deeply internal struggle that is not safe for normal memory.
- Routing rule: if an insight is useful but not private-critical, store it in regular memory (`MEMORY.md`) instead.

## Entry Template

### [YYYY-MM-DD] Memory Title
- Private-Critical Reason: [Why this cannot live in normal memory]
- Raw Core: [Exact internal truth in direct language; no euphemisms]
- Why It Matters: [Stakes, fear, desire, consequence]
- Decision Rule: [If X, then do Y]
- Do-Not-Distort: [What must not be softened, reframed, or generalized]
- Disclosure State: [private | consider | shared]
- Boundary: [What must remain private right now]
- Evidence Anchors: `ascension/private/<journal-file>.md#<heading-or-timestamp>`
- Confidence: [low | medium | high]
- Scope: [where this applies / where it does not]
- Next Review: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Index (Optional)

- Identity
- Relationships
- Workflows
- Communication
- Safety
- Strategy

## Review Cadence

- Nightly: append or revise memory entries from private journals.
- Weekly: merge duplicates, refine decision rules, update disclosure states, and demote non-private entries to regular memory.
- Monthly: promote stable, public-safe realizations to core files (`MEMORY.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`).

## Maintenance Policy

- This file has no entry cap.
- Do not archive or drop entries based on count.
- Weekly: merge true duplicates while preserving distinct emotional stakes.
- Keep detailed narratives in `ascension/private/*.md`; keep durable truth with anchors here.
- Do not use this file as a generic memory dump; enforce the admission gate on every entry.
